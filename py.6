To determine if Chef is prone to errors based on his current brain speed and the threshold limit, we need to compare two values, 
𝑋
X and 
𝑌
Y. If 
𝑌
Y (the current brain speed) is greater than 
𝑋
X (the threshold limit), then Chef is prone to errors, otherwise, he is not.

Solution Explanation
Input: Read two integers, 
𝑋
X and 
𝑌
Y.
Comparison: Compare 
𝑌
Y with 
𝑋
X.
Output:
Print "YES" if 
𝑌
Y is greater than 
𝑋
X.
Print "NO" if 
𝑌
Y is less than or equal to 
𝑋
X.
Implementation
Here's the Python code to solve this problem:

python
# Read input values
X, Y = map(int, input().strip().split())

# Determine if Chef is prone to errors
if Y > X:
    print("YES")
else:
    print("NO")
